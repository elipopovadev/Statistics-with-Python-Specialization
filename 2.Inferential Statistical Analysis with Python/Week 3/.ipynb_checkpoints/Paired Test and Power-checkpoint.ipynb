    "A common situation in applied research is to measure the same quantity multiple times on each unit of analysis. For example, in NHANES, systolic blood pressure is measured at least two times (sometimes there is a third measurement) on each subject. Although the measurements are repeated, there is no guarantee that the mean is the same each time, i.e. the mean blood pressure may be slightly lower on the second measurement compared to the first, since people are a bit more nervous the first time they are measured. A paired test is a modified form of mean test that can be used when we are comparing two repeated measurements on the same unit.\n",

Below we see that in the entire NHANES sample, the first measurement of systolic blood pressure is on average 0.67 mm/Hg greater than the second measurement. While this difference is not large, it is strongly statistically significant. That is, there is strong evidence that the mean values for the first and second blood pressure measurement differ.\n"

    "The simulation below randomly subsamples sets of 100, 200, 400, and 800 people from the 50-60 year old subset of NHANES, and conducts a paired z-test on each subsample. This process is repeated 500 times for each sample size. We report the fraction of these 500 trials where the p-value was smaller than 0.05. A higher fraction of trials where p<0.05 implies that it is easier to detect a difference between the first and second blood pressure measurements. We see that this proportion (called \"statistical power\") is only around 0.2 when the sample size is 100, and grows to essentially 100% when the sample size is 800. Note that all of these subsamples are drawn from the same parent population, so there is no change from subsample to subsample in terms of whether the means are truly different. The only thing that changes is our evidence that the difference is real. When the sample size is small, we rarely amass such evidence.\n"
